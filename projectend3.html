		<p>As you turn away from the bridge, your jacket gets caught. Unprepared and still dizzy from the previous attack you fall back onto the bridge.</p>

		<p>CRACK.</p>

		<p>Unable to support your weight, the bridge disintegrates.</p>

		<p> You fall head first onto the rocks and the pain makes it hard to breathe. You slowly struggle as the water gently drowns you.</p>
